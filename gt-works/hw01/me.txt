Hello, I am Tai Park, and I do not have a major right now because I am not in college yet.
I am a senior Seckinger High School, but I am still not sure of what major I wish to be in the future.
Some things I like to do are produce and listen to music, sleep, and think about life.
I do things mainly in the field of music, as I am in my school's marching band and play trumpet.
I also occasionally watch anime and read manga in case I have the free time.
I decided to take CS 1331 because I had taken CS 1301 last year during the spring semester after being offered it.
I figured I could take the sequel to CS 1301 by taking CS 1331, not for any big reason in particular.
