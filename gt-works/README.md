# Installing Java Guide (JDK 11)

## Windows
- Uninstall any existing versions of Java (if any) on your PC.
- Download and install: https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.60.19-ca-fx-jdk11.0.17win_x64.msi
- Restart your PC.
- See HW0 for steps to check if it is correctly installed.
- If steps did not work (usually shows some Java but not the expected one), follow these steps to change the JVM:
  - Note the installation path of the JDK (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk11`).
  - You can either do **A** or **B**:

  **A.** Use the `setx` command as so (replace the path with your installation path):

  ```powershell
  setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk11" /m
  ```

  **B.** Update your `PATH`:
  1. Type "env" into search.
  2. Click **Edit environment variables**.
  3. Click **Environment variables** at the bottom.
  4. Under **User Variables**, select **Path**.
  5. Click **Edit**.
  6. Add a new line (**New**).
  7. Add the installation path noted earlier, then add `\bin` to the end.
  8. Save and close environment variables windows.
  9. Restart your PC.

- Consult with TAs if steps did not work.
