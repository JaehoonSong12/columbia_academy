\textbf{Note}: These problems are often a little challenging the first time around 
so there is an extra point available on this homework. That is, 24 points are 
available but you'll still be graded out of 23.

\textit{For each part, please simplify your answer to a single integer; you may use 
a calculator. If it is helpful, you may use your answer to any part in any 
subsequent part. Please remember to give some verbal indication of your 
process in addition to just doing the necessary calculations.}
